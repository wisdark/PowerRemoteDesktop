# Power Remote Desktop

<img src="Assets/prdp-banner.png" width="100%"/>

*Power Remote Desktop* is a fully functional Remote Desktop Application entirely coded in PowerShell.

It doesn't rely on any existing Remote Desktop Application or Protocol to function. A serious advantage of this application is its nature (PowerShell) and its ease of use and installation.

This project demonstrate why PowerShell contains the word *Power*. It is unfortunately often an underestimated programming language that is not only resumed to running commands or being a more fancy replacement to the old Windows command-line interpreter (cmd).

Tested on:

* **Windows 10**
* **Windows 11**

Current version: **4.0.0 Stable**

## Performance

Enjoy better streaming performance and a better experience using **PowerShell 7** instead of **PowerShell 5**.

You can install PowerShell 7 for Windows [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.2)

---

## Highlighted Features

<img src="Assets/image31.png" width="100%"/>

* Remote Desktop Streaming with support of HDPI and Scaling.
* Remote Control: Mouse (Moves, Clicks, Wheel) and Key Strokes (Keyboard)
* **Secure**: Network traffic is encrypted using TLSv1.2 or 1.3. Access to server is granted via a challenge-based authentication mechanism (using user defined complex password).
* Network traffic encryption is using whether a default X509 Certificate (Requires Administrator) or your custom X509 Certificate.
* Server certificate fingerprint validation supported and optionally persistent between sessions.
* Clipboard text synchronization between Viewer and Server.
* Mouse cursor icon state is synchronized between Viewer (Virtual Desktop) and Server.
* Multi-Screen (Monitor) support. If remote computer have more than one desktop screen, you can choose which desktop screen to capture.
* View Only mode for demonstration. You can disable remote control abilities and just show your screen to remote peer.
* Session concurrency. Multiple viewers can connect to a single server at the same time.
* Prevent computer to enter in sleep mode while server is waiting for viewers.
* Only pieces of desktop that was updated are sent to viewer to increase streaming speed.

## Setup everything in less than a minute (Fast Setup)

````powershell
Install-Module -Name PowerRemoteDesktop_Server

Invoke-RemoteDesktopServer -CertificateFile "<certificate_location>"
````

If you are even more lazy and want to avoid using your own certificate, remove `CertificateFile` option but you will need to run PowerShell as Administrator.

````powershell
Install-Module -Name PowerRemoteDesktop_Viewer

Invoke-RemoteDesktopViewer -ServerAddress "<ip_address>" -Password "<the_one_displayed_on_server>"
````

Thats it üòâ

## Detailed Installation and Instructions

You will find multiple ways to use this PowerShell Applications. Recommended method would be to install both Server and Viewer using the PowerShell Gallery but you can also do it manually as an installed module or imported script.

### Install as a PowerShell Module from PowerShell Gallery (**Recommended**)

You can install Power Remote Desktop from PowerShell Gallery. See PowerShell Gallery as the 'equivalent' of Aptitude for Debian or Brew for MacOS.

Run the following commands:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PowerRemoteDesktop_Server

Install-Module -Name PowerRemoteDesktop_Viewer
```

`AllowPrerelease` is mandatory when current version is marked as a *Prerelease*

Your command prompt will show the following warning:

```
Untrusted repository
You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change its
InstallationPolicy value by running the Set-PSRepository cmdlet. Are you sure you want to install the modules from
'PSGallery'?
```

Answer `Y` to proceed installation.

Both modules should now be available, you can verify using the command:

```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable
```

Example Output:

```
PS C:\Users\Phrozen\Desktop> Get-Module -ListAvailable


    Directory: C:\Users\Phrozen\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules


ModuleType Version    Name                                ExportedCommands
---------- -------    ----                                ----------------
Manifest   1.0.0      PowerRemoteDesktop_Server           Invoke-RemoteDesktopServer
Manifest   1.0.0      PowerRemoteDesktop_Viewer           Invoke-RemoteDesktopViewer

<..snip..>
```

If you don't see them, run the following commands and check back.

```powershell
Import-Module PowerRemoteDesktop_Server

Import-Module PowerRemoteDesktop_Viewer
```

### Install as a PowerShell Module (Manually / Unmanaged)

To be available, the module must first be present in a registered module path.

You can list module paths with following command:

```powershell
Write-Output $env:PSModulePath
```

Example Output:

```
C:\Users\Phrozen\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules;C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules;C:\WINDOWS\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules
```

Clone PowerRemoteDesktop repository or download a Github release package.

```
git clone https://github.com/DarkCoderSc/PowerRemoteDesktop.git
```

Copy both *PowerRemoteDesktop_Viewer* and *PowerRemoteDesktop_Server* folders to desired module path 

Example: 

```
C:\Users\<USER>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
```

Both modules should now be available, you can verify using the command:

```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable
```

Example Output:

```
PS C:\Users\Phrozen\Desktop> Get-Module -ListAvailable


    Directory: C:\Users\Phrozen\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules

Manifest   1.0.0      PowerRemoteDesktop_Viewer           Invoke-RemoteDesktopViewer

<..snip..>
```

If you don't see them, run the following commands and check back.

```powershell
Import-Module PowerRemoteDesktop_Server

Import-Module PowerRemoteDesktop_Viewer
```

Notice: Manifest files are optional (`*.psd1`) and can be removed.

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notices

Prefer using `SecurePassword` over plain-text password even if a plain-text password is getting converted to `SecureString` anyway.

#### Example

Open a new remote desktop session to `127.0.0.1:2801` with password `urCompl3xP@ssw0rd`

```powershell
Invoke-RemoteDesktopViewer -ServerAddress "127.0.0.1" -ServerPort 2801 -SecurePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "urCompl3xP@ssw0rd" -AsPlainText -Force)
```

#### Enumerate Trusted Servers

When a fingerprint is met for the first time, viewer will ask you if you want to trust this new remote server fingerprint.

When you choose the `[A] Always` option, this fingerprint will be saved to local user registry. If you change your mind, you can revoke trsuted fingerprint at any time using dedicated functions.

```powershell
Get-TrustedServers
```

Example output:

````

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notices

1. Prefer using `SecurePassword` over plain-text password even if a plain-text password is getting converted to `SecureString` anyway.
2. Not specifying a custom certificate using `CertificateFile` or `EncodedCertificate` result in generating a default self-signed certificate (if not already generated) that will get installed on local machine thus requiring administrator privilege. If you want to run the server as a non-privileged account, specify your own certificate location.
3. If you don't specify a `SecurePassword` or `Password`, a random complex password will be generated and displayed on terminal (this password is temporary).

##### Examples

```powershell
Invoke-RemoteDesktopServer -ListenAddress "0.0.0.0" -ListenPort 2801 -SecurePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "urCompl3xP@ssw0rd" -AsPlainText -Force)

Invoke-RemoteDesktopServer -ListenAddress "0.0.0.0" -ListenPort 2801 -SecurePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "urCompl3xP@ssw0rd" -AsPlainText -Force) -CertificateFile "c:\certs\phrozen.p12"
```

#### How to capture LogonUI

Since version 4.0.0, it is possible to capture **LogonUI** / **Winlogon** (UAC Prompt, Windows Login Window, CTRL+ALT+DEL etc...).

‚ö†Ô∏è To be able to capture LogonUI, you must run your server under the context of **NT AUTHORITY/System** in the current active session.

Multiple methods exists to spawn a process as **SYSTEM User** under active session (Ex: PsExec, Process Hacker)

For simplicity I recommend using one of my other projects called [PowerRunAsSystem](https://github.com/DarkCoderSc/PowerRunAsSystem) 

You can install this module using your favorite method, for example with PowerShell Gallery

````powershell
Install-Module -Name PowerRunAsSystem
````

Then run bellow command as Administrator.

```powershell
Invoke-InteractiveSystemPowerShell
```

A new PowerShell terminal should appear on your desktop as **NT AUTHORITY/System**

You can now enter your Power Remote Desktop server command, future Power Remote Desktop viewer will now be able to use the option `LogonUI` to request LogonUI / Winlogon desktop on active session.

#### Generate and pass your own X509 Certificate

‚ö†Ô∏è Remember that not using your own X509 certificate will result in requiring administrator privilege to create a new server.

Fortunately, you can easily create your own X509 certificate for example with the help of [OpenSSL command line tool](https://www.openssl.org).

##### Generate your Certificate

```
openssl req -x509 -sha512 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout phrozen.key -out phrozen.crt
```

Then export the new certificate (**must include private key**).

```
openssl pkcs12 -export -out phrozen.p12 -inkey phrozen.key -in phrozen.crt
```

##### Integrate to server as a file

Use `CertificateFile`. Example: `c:\tlscert\phrozen.crt`

##### Integrate to server as a base64 representation

Encode an existing certificate using PowerShell

```powershell
[convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path "c:\tlscert\phrozen.crt" -Encoding byte))
```
or on Linux / Mac systems

```
base64 -i /tmp/phrozen.p12
```

You can then pass the output base64 certificate file to parameter `EncodedCertificate` (One line)
